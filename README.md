The maiden repository of knowledge and resources in your possession, constituting your first library.

* The C programming language is a general-purpose programming language initially developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. It has become one of the most widely used programming languages and serves as the foundation for many other programming languages. C is known for its low-level control over computer hardware, efficiency, and portability.

* C is commonly used for developing system software, embedded systems, device drivers, compilers, and other performance-critical applications. It provides a structured approach to programming, with features such as functions, loops, conditional statements, and data types. The language also allows direct manipulation of memory addresses and pointers, which gives programmers more control but also requires careful management to avoid errors.

• Your project must adhere to the C language requirement.

• Your project must conform to the Norm guidelines. Bonus files/functions will be checked for norm errors, and any such errors will result in a grade of 0.

• Your functions should not terminate abruptly with errors such as segmentation fault, bus error, or double free, except in cases of undefined behavior. Failure to meet this requirement will result in a non-functional evaluation and a grade of 0.

• All dynamically allocated memory must be correctly freed when no longer needed. No memory leaks will be allowed.

• If required by the subject, you must provide a Makefile that compiles your source files to the specified output. The Makefile should include the flags -Wall, -Wextra, and -Werror, use the cc compiler, and must not relink.


• Your Makefile should include at least the following rules: $(NAME), all, clean, fclean, and re.
